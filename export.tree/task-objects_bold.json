Each stimulus class was presented in 4-second mini-blocks with items presented at 2 Hz (8 items per mini-block). In each run, 12 mini-blocks of each class were presented along 12 interspersed 4-second fixation blocks (acquisition time: 5:13). Half of the blocks included a single phase-scrambled image; the subject\u2019s task was to press a button whenever a phase-scrambled item appeared.", "PulseSequenceType": "Multiband EPI", "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-", "MultibandAccelerationFactor": 4, "EffectiveEchoSpacing": 0.0003100013888062219, "ManufacturersModelName": "Skyra", "TaskName": "objects", "Manufacturer": "Siemens"}
