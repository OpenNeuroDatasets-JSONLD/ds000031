This stimulus creates a wave of activation throughout retinotopically organized visual areas, successively and systematically stimulating portions of each map. In this way, the entire visual field is represented by a time- dependent pattern of activity across space. In each of four fMRI runs, the wedge completed 12 cycles of rotation (acquisition time = 4:00 per run).", "PulseSequenceType": "Multiband EPI", "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-", "MultibandAccelerationFactor": 4, "EffectiveEchoSpacing": 0.0003100013888062219, "ManufacturersModelName": "Skyra", "TaskName": "retinotopy", "Manufacturer": "Siemens"}
