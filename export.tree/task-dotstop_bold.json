On each trial, a moving dot stimulus (Britten et al., 1992) was presented, with coherence of either upward or downward motion varying across trials (levels: 0%, 10%, 30%, and 70% coherence). On 25% of trials, a visual stop signal (change of the fixation cross from white to red) was presented, at a delay controlled by a 1 up/1down staircase in order to ensure 50% stopping accuracy (Logan, 1994). The subject\u2019s task was to perform the motion discrimination as quickly as possible, but withhold responses when the stop signal occurred (acquisition time = 7:11).", "PulseSequenceType": "Multiband EPI", "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-", "MultibandAccelerationFactor": 4, "EffectiveEchoSpacing": 0.0003100013888062219, "ManufacturersModelName": "Skyra", "TaskName": "dotstop", "Manufacturer": "Siemens"}
