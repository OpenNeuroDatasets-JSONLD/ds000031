On each trial, a 4 X 2 spatial grid was presented, and locations in that grid were presented sequentially (1000 ms per location), followed by a forced-choice probe between two grids, one of which contained all of the locations presented in the preceding series. In the easy condition, one location was presented on each presentation, whereas in the hard condition two locations were presented. Twelve 32-second experimental blocks were interspersed with 4 16- second fixation blocks (acquisition time = 7:28).", "PulseSequenceType": "Multiband EPI", "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-", "MultibandAccelerationFactor": 4, "EffectiveEchoSpacing": 0.0003100013888062219, "ManufacturersModelName": "Skyra", "TaskName": "spatial wm", "Manufacturer": "Siemens"}
